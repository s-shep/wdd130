        <h2 class="soap-titles"> Soap Process </h2>
        <p> In the art of making soap, there are three ways to create soap: 
            Cold Process, Hot Process and Melt & Pour. The first two are more complicated and 
            while both will be covered, they will not be recommended for first time soap makers. 
            As both require the use of Lye which if handled incorrectly can be very dangerous. 
            Adding lye to soap requires the soap to go through a stage of saponification. 
            Which is the process of combining lye with your oils.  
            All soap will need time to dry but each process has different drying or curing times.</p>
    
        <section class="cold-process">
        <h2 class="soap-title">Cold Process </h2>
        <p>
            This process is based off of a 30/30/30/10 ratio. That is 30% Olive Oil, 30% Coconut oil, 30 % palm oil and 
            10% of your choice or oils and/or butters. Shae butter and Sweet Almond Oil are more commonly used at the 
            remailing 10%. Changing the 10% to something like avocado oil, beeswax, coco butter, all have different ratios 
            and different shelf life in soap. It is recommended that the research is done heavily on what oils you want to 
            use and how it will react to each other. Cold Processed soap requires Lye and depending on the oils used the 
            lye ratio is different. Using an online lye calculator is best. Cold processed soap does require a min 4-week 
            drying time. WARNING when using LYE do not use anything aluminum or tin. Lye will react badly if used.  
        </p>

    <section class="hot-process">
        <h2 class="soap-title"> Hot Processed Soap</h2>
        <p>
            Hot Processed Soap can be made in a crock pot. This process requires about 10 oz of olive oil, 
            20 oz of coconut oil, 9 oz of distilled water and lye. Using a online lye calculator is best which 
            calculating the amount of lye to use in a recipe. Hot processed soap requires to be brought up to a 
            temperature of 140 degrees before adding in a scent. This process only requires a minimum of 2 weeks to 
            harden and cure. WARNING when using LYE do not use anything aluminum or tin. Lye will react badly if used.

    <section class="melt-pour">
        <h2 class="soap-title">Melt & Pour </h2>
        <p>
            Melt & Pour is the easiest and quickest way to make soap. 
            Melt & Pour soap has already gone through the saponification process. 
            The lye in the Melt & Pour has already been combined and is safe to use as soon as the soap has hardened.
             Melt & Pour can be purchased online usually by the pound. This process is the most recommended for 
             soap makers who are just beginning. The drying or curing time is usually up to 48 hours.  
             This process will be the main process used.
