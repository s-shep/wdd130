        Soap Process</p>
        <p>In the art of making soap, there are three ways to create soap: Cold Process, Hot Process and Melt & Pour. 
        The first two are more complicated and while both will be covered, they will not be recommended for first time soap makers. 
        As both require the use of Lye which if handled incorrectly can be very dangerous. Adding lye to soap requires the soap to go through a stage of saponification.
         Which is the process of combining lye with your oils.  All soap will need time to dry but each process has different drying or curing times.</p>
        <p>Cold Process</p>
              <p>This process is based off of a 30/30/30/10 ratio. That is 30% Olive Oil, 30% Coconut oil, 30 % palm oil and 10% of your choice or oils and/or butters.
           Shae butter and Sweet Almond Oil are more commonly used at the remailing 10%. 
           Changing the 10% to something like avocado oil, beeswax, coco butter, all have different ratios and different shelf life in soap. 
           It is recommended that the research is done heavily on what oils you want to use and how it will react to each other.
          Cold Processed soap requires Lye and depending on the oils used the lye ratio is different. Using an online lye calculator is best. 
          Cold processed soap does require a min 4-week drying time. WARNING when using LYE do not use anything aluminum or tin. Lye will react badly if used. </p>
          <p>Hot Processed Soap</p>
           <p> Hot Processed Soap can be made in a crock pot. This process requires about 10 oz of olive oil, 20 oz of coconut oil, 9 oz of distilled water and lye. 
            Using a online lye calculator is best which calculating the amount of lye to use in a recipe. 
            Hot processed soap requires to be brought up to a temperature of 140 degrees before adding in a scent. 
            This process only requires a minimum of 2 weeks to harden and cure. WARNING when using LYE do not use anything aluminum or tin. Lye will react badly if used.
            </p>
            <p>Melt & Pour</p>
             <p> Melt & Pour is the easiest and quickest way to make soap. Melt & Pour soap has already gone through the saponification process. 
              The lye in the Melt & Pour has already been combined and is safe to use as soon as the soap has hardened. 
              Melt & Pour can be purchased online usually by the pound. This process is the most recommended for soap makers who are just beginning. 
              The drying or curing time is usually up to 48 hours.  This process will be the main process used.

        Melt & Pour Soap base
      </p>
      <p>There are many different types of Melt & Pour Soap base. Depending on what kind is used changes the color that is added to the base. 
        If using an oatmeal, goat milk, or any base that is white will make the colors pastel when added to the base. 
        If using a glycerin or clear base will make colors darker and richer. Think about what colors that are going to be used to determine what base to use. </p>
        <p>Mica</p>
        <p>Mica is mineral that has color. This is the best to use in adding color to the soap. It is perfectly safe to use in soap and is even used in make-up. </p>
        <p>Scents</p>
        <p>Essential oils or fragrance oils that are safe to the skin can be used in soap. Only use 0.3 ounces per pound of Melt & Pour soap. </p>
        <p>Added Extras</p>
        <p>While herbs and dry ingredients like chia seeds, cornmeal, oatmeal or coffee can be added to a bases be mindful of adding moister to the base. 
          Adding moisture and cause the soap to not harden. Also adding any fresh ingredients like flower petals can discolor when added to the soap and cause rot. </p>
        <p>Equipment</p>
        <p>Microwaveable Glass bowels, silicone spatulas, and silicone soap molds are the main items needed to make soap. </p>
        <p>Starting</p>
        <p>Once the materials are gathered, all that is left is to melt the Melt & Pour and add your colors, ingredients and pour in a silicone mold. 
          Once it is hardened it is safe to use. </p>

      <h3>Designs</h3>
      <p>Some tools that can be used for designing soap, is any silicone mold. Silicone has a lot of give and the soap will be easy to take out. 
        Using what are called “Embeds” which are small molds used to decorate bars of soap. These embeds can be letters, cuts of old soap, 
        or really any small items that can go into the soap. It is even possible with homemade silicone to create your own mold.
      </p>
      <p>Another tool that might be more common in the house is a wire hanger. With a larger mold, putting layers of color on
        each bother and using a wire hanger, patterns can be created. This would mix the layers together creating circles and a wavy pattern. 
      </p>
      <p> Keeping in mind that the smaller the mold the harder it will be to take out the soap.  Be careful of overloading your soap and adding to many embeds might 
          change the drying/curing time. Adding embeds or designs while the soap is still very wet can be messy but overall fun.
          Whatever the designs end up, just have fun with it. With Melt & Pour soap you can remelt down the soap and try again, but what colors you have added will still be there.

        Here are some Creative Examples to recreate.
