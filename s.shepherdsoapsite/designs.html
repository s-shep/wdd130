                Some tools that can be used for designing soap, is any silicone mold. 
                Silicone has a lot of give and the soap will be easy to take out. 
                Using what are called “Embeds” which are small molds used to decorate bars of soap. 
                These embeds can be letters, cuts of old soap, or really any small items that can go into the soap. 
                It is even possible with homemade silicone to create your own mold.

                    Another tool that might be more common in the house is a wire hanger. 
                    With a larger mold, putting layers of color on each bother and using a wire hanger, 
                    patterns can be created. This would mix the layers together creating circles and a wavy pattern. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keeping in mind that the smaller the mold the harder it will be to take out the soap.  
                    Be careful of overloading your soap and adding to many embeds might change the drying/curing time. 
                    Adding embeds or designs while the soap is still very wet can be messy but overall fun. 
                    Whatever the designs end up, just have fun with it. With Melt & Pour soap you can remelt down the 
                    soap and try again, but what colors you have added will still be there.
