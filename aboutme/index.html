        <h2>Sariha Shepherd</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Sariha. I am going back to school for my second Bachelors in Applied Technology. My first degree is in Marriage and family studies, as I wanted to be a social worker.
            I did my internsihip as a social woker and realized it was not the field for me. I currently work at a Foster Care Agency as a Records and Clearance Specialist.  </p>
            <p>I live with my mom and older brother, in a small town in northren Califonria. I have been a member all of my life and I currently have two callings in my YSA Branch. I am the music/chior director and the family history consultant. 
                At lest for another 6 months before I age out of the YSA. </p>
                <p> Somethings I like doing is making soap, painting, sewing, reading and watching movies. My favorite type of movies are Disney and scary movies. 
                    I also play video/board games. I also enjoy hiking and camping but haven't had a chance to do either due to the fires in California. </p>
                    <p> I am excited to learn web design, in the future I would love to make my own website selling my homemade soap.</p>
                    <p>My favorite quote is about how we are eternal beings having an earthly experience and not earthly beings having an eternal experience. </p>
